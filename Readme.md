HOS-Ocean is a numerical model dedicated to the propagation of non-linear wave fields in open ocean with arbitrary constant depth. It is based on the High-Order Spectral (HOS) method which enables the simulation of highly non-linear wavefields. It has been developed at Ecole Centrale de Nantes since 2005 and is used in several research projects.
